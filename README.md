# DJS07 - Build a Meme Generator

# Project Brief 
- In this challenge/project, I was required to code-along the Scrimba lesson: [(https://scrimba.com/playlist/prXJpCQ)]

# Project Overview
- This starter repo only has CSS styling added to the empty React project.
- After cloning run npm install to install dependencies.

# Reflections
### Areas of Mastery
- React Component Creation - This project involved building React components to structure the meme generator. I was able to define reusable components for different UI elements (image display, text input fields, buttons) and composing these components together to form the overall application.

- Dynamic UI with User Input - I was able to build a dynamic user interface which handled user input from text fields to capture meme captions and updated the displayed meme image with the entered captions in real-time (likely using React's state management)

### Challenges faced
- Juggling Components and Data Flow - Coordinating multiple React components and ensuring proper data flow between them was tricky, as it was my first time building a UI with React.

- State Management - While the Scrimba lesson might have used a simple state management solution, keeping track of meme image selection, captions, and other dynamic elements were a challenge.

### Areas of Improvement
- Adding advanced features like allowing the user to add features like font selection, color adjustments, or meme template options.
- State Management
- Juggling Components and Data Flow 

# Overall Learning Experiencing
- I experienced the ability to create an interactive interfaces that responds to user actions and the importance of state management in keeping track of dynamic data within the application. I find React so fascinating and I look forward to the next projects!
